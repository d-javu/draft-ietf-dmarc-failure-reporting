<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
(DMARC) <xref target="RFC7489"></xref> is a scalable mechanism by which a
mail-originating organization can express domain-level policies and
preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, that a
mail-receiving organization can use to improve mail handling. This
document focuses on one type of reporting that can be requested under
DMARC.</t>

<t>
Failure reports provide detailed information about the failure of a single
message or a group of similar messages failing for the same reason. They
are meant to aid in cases where a domain owner is unable to detect why
failures reported in aggregate form did occur. It is important to note
these reports can contain either the header or the entire content of a
failed message, which in turn may contain personally identifiable
information, which should be considered when deciding whether to
generate such reports.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology and Definitions</name>
<t>This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.</t>
<t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"></xref> <xref target="RFC8174"></xref>
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
<t>Readers are expected to be familiar with the contents of <xref target="RFC7489"></xref>,
specifically the terminology and definitions section.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="failure-reports"><name>Failure Reports</name>
<t>Providing Domain Owners with visibility into how Mail Receivers
implement and enforce the DMARC mechanism in the form of feedback is
critical to establishing and maintaining accurate authentication
deployments. Failure reports can supply more detailed information
about messages that failed to authenticate, enabling the Domain Owner
to determine exactly what might be causing those specific failures.</t>
<t>Failure reports are normally generated and sent almost immediately
after the Mail Receiver detects a DMARC failure.  Rather than waiting
for an aggregate report, these reports are useful for quickly
notifying the Domain Owners when there is an authentication failure.
Whether the failure is due to an infrastructure problem or the
message is inauthentic, failure reports also provide more information
about the failed message than is available in an aggregate report.</t>
<t>These reports SHOULD include any URI(s) from the message that failed
authentication.  These reports SHOULD include as much of the message
and message header as is reasonable to support the Domain Owner's
investigation into what caused the message to fail authentication and
track down the sender.</t>
<t>When a Domain Owner requests failure reports for the purpose of
forensic analysis, and the Mail Receiver is willing to provide such
reports, the Mail Receiver generates and sends a message using the
format described in <xref target="RFC6591"></xref>; this document updates that reporting
format, as described in <xref target="reporting-format-update"></xref>.</t>
<t>The destination(s) and nature of the reports are defined by the &quot;ruf&quot;
and &quot;fo&quot; tags as defined in (<xref target="RFC7489"></xref> general-record-format).</t>
<t>Where multiple URIs are selected to receive failure reports, the
report generator MUST make an attempt to deliver to each of them.</t>
<t>An obvious consideration is the denial-of-service attack that can be
perpetrated by an attacker who sends numerous messages purporting to
be from the intended victim Domain Owner but that fail both SPF and
DKIM; this would cause participating Mail Receivers to send failure
reports to the Domain Owner or its delegate in potentially huge
volumes.  Accordingly, participating Mail Receivers are encouraged to
aggregate these reports as much as is practical, using the Incidents
field of the Abuse Reporting Format (<xref target="RFC5965"></xref>).  Various aggregation
techniques are possible, including the following:</t>

<ul>
<li><t>only send a report to the first recipient of multi-recipient
messages;</t>
</li>
<li><t>store reports for a period of time before sending them, allowing
detection, collection, and reporting of like incidents;</t>
</li>
<li><t>apply rate limiting, such as a maximum number of reports per
minute that will be generated (and the remainder discarded).</t>
</li>
</ul>

<section anchor="reporting-format-update"><name>Reporting Format Update</name>
<t>Operators implementing this specification also implement an augmented
version of <xref target="RFC6591"></xref> as follows:</t>

<ol>
<li><t>A DMARC failure report includes the following ARF header fields,
with the indicated normative requirement levels:</t>

<ul>
<li><t>Identity-Alignment (REQUIRED; defined below)</t>
</li>
<li><t>Delivery-Result (OPTIONAL)</t>
</li>
<li><t>DKIM-Domain, DKIM-Identity, DKIM-Selector (REQUIRED if the
message was signed by DKIM)</t>
</li>
<li><t>DKIM-Canonicalized-Header, DKIM-Canonicalized-Body (OPTIONAL
if the message was signed by DKIM)</t>
</li>
<li><t>SPF-DNS (REQUIRED)</t>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><t>The &quot;Identity-Alignment&quot; field is defined to contain a comma-
separated list of authentication mechanism names that produced an
aligned identity, or the keyword &quot;none&quot; if none did.  ABNF:</t>
</li>
</ol>

<artwork>  id-align     = &quot;Identity-Alignment:&quot; [CFWS]
                 ( &quot;none&quot; /
                   dmarc-method *( [CFWS] &quot;,&quot; [CFWS] dmarc-method ) )
                 [CFWS]

  dmarc-method = ( &quot;dkim&quot; / &quot;spf&quot; )
                 ; each may appear at most once in an id-align
</artwork>

<ol start="3">
<li>Authentication Failure Type &quot;dmarc&quot; is defined, which is to be
used when a failure report is generated because some or all of
the authentication mechanisms failed to produce aligned
identifiers.  Note that a failure report generator MAY also
independently produce an AFRF message for any or all of the
underlying authentication methods.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section anchor="verifying-external-destinations"><name>Verifying External Destinations</name>
<t>It is possible to specify destinations for the different reports that
are outside the authority of the Domain Owner making the request.
This allows domains that do not operate mail servers to request
reports and have them go someplace that is able to receive and
process them.</t>
<t>Without checks, this would allow a bad actor to publish a DMARC
policy record that requests that reports be sent to a victim address,
and then send a large volume of mail that will fail both DKIM and SPF
checks to a wide variety of destinations; the victim will in turn be
flooded with unwanted reports.  Therefore, a verification mechanism
is included.</t>
<t>When a Mail Receiver discovers a DMARC policy in the DNS, and the
Organizational Domain at which that record was discovered is not
identical to the Organizational Domain of the host part of the
authority component of a <xref target="RFC3986"></xref> specified in the &quot;rua&quot; or &quot;ruf&quot; tag,
the following verification steps are to be taken:</t>

<ol>
<li><t>Extract the host portion of the authority component of the URI.
Call this the &quot;destination host&quot;, as it refers to a Report
Receiver.</t>
</li>
<li><t>Prepend the string &quot;_report._dmarc&quot;.</t>
</li>
<li><t>Prepend the domain name from which the policy was retrieved,
after conversion to an A-label if needed.</t>
</li>
<li><t>Query the DNS for a TXT record at the constructed name.  If the
result of this request is a temporary DNS error of some kind
(e.g., a timeout), the Mail Receiver MAY elect to temporarily
fail the delivery so the verification test can be repeated later.</t>
</li>
<li><t>For each record returned, parse the result as a series of
&quot;tag=value&quot; pairs, i.e., the same overall format as the policy
record (see (<xref target="RFC7489"></xref> formal-definition)).  In particular, the &quot;v=DMARC1;&quot; tag is
mandatory and MUST appear first in the list.  Discard any that do
not pass this test.</t>
</li>
<li><t>If the result includes no TXT resource records that pass basic
parsing, a positive determination of the external reporting
relationship cannot be made; stop.</t>
</li>
<li><t>If at least one TXT resource record remains in the set after
parsing, then the external reporting arrangement was authorized
by the Report Receiver.</t>
</li>
<li><t>If a &quot;rua&quot; or &quot;ruf&quot; tag is thus discovered, replace the
corresponding value extracted from the domain's DMARC policy
record with the one found in this record.  This permits the
Report Receiver to override the report destination.  However, to
prevent loops or indirect abuse, the overriding URI MUST use the
same destination host from the first step.</t>
</li>
</ol>
<t>For example, if a DMARC policy query for &quot;blue.example.com&quot; contained
&quot;rua=mailto:reports@red.example.net&quot;, the host extracted from the
latter (&quot;red.example.net&quot;) does not match &quot;blue.example.com&quot;, so this
procedure is enacted.  A TXT query for
&quot;blue.example.com._report._dmarc.red.example.net&quot; is issued.  If a
single reply comes back containing a tag of &quot;v=DMARC1;&quot;, then the
relationship between the two is confirmed.  Moreover,
&quot;red.example.net&quot; has the opportunity to override the report
destination requested by &quot;blue.example.com&quot; if needed.</t>
<t>Where the above algorithm fails to confirm that the external
reporting was authorized by the Report Receiver, the URI MUST be
ignored by the Mail Receiver generating the report.  Further, if the
confirming record includes a URI whose host is again different than
the domain publishing that override, the Mail Receiver generating the
report MUST NOT generate a report to either the original or the
override URI.</t>
<t>A Report Receiver publishes such a record in its DNS if it wishes to
receive reports for other domains.</t>
<t>A Report Receiver that is willing to receive reports for any domain
can use a wildcard DNS record.  For example, a TXT resource record at
&quot;*._report._dmarc.example.com&quot; containing at least &quot;v=DMARC1;&quot;
confirms that example.com is willing to receive DMARC reports for any
domain.</t>
<t>If the Report Receiver is overcome by volume, it can simply remove
the confirming DNS record.  However, due to positive caching, the
change could take as long as the time-to-live (TTL) on the record to
go into effect.</t>
<t>A Mail Receiver might decide not to enact this procedure if, for
example, it relies on a local list of domains for which external
reporting addresses are permitted.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations"><name>Privacy Considerations</name>
<t>This section discusses issues specific to private data that
may be included in the DMARC reporting functions.</t>

<section anchor="data-exposure-considerations"><name>Data Exposure Considerations</name>
<t>Failed-message reporting provides message-specific details pertaining
to authentication failures.  Individual reports can contain message
content as well as trace header fields.  Domain Owners are able to
analyze individual reports and attempt to determine root causes of
authentication mechanism failures, gain insight into
misconfigurations or other problems with email and network
infrastructure, or inspect messages for insight into abusive
practices.</t>
<t>These reports may expose sender and recipient identifiers (e.g.,
RFC5322.From addresses), and although the <xref target="RFC6591"></xref> format used for
failed-message reporting supports redaction, failed-message reporting
is capable of exposing the entire message to the report recipient.</t>
<t>Domain Owners requesting reports will receive information about mail
claiming to be from them, which includes mail that was not, in fact,
from them.  Information about the final destination of mail where it
might otherwise be obscured by intermediate systems will therefore be
exposed.</t>
<t>When message-forwarding arrangements exist, Domain Owners requesting
reports will also receive information about mail forwarded to domains
that were not originally part of their messages' recipient lists.
This means that destination domains previously unknown to the Domain
Owner may now become visible.</t>
<t>Disclosure of information about the messages is being requested by
the entity generating the email in the first place, i.e., the Domain
Owner and not the Mail Receiver, so this may not fit squarely within
existing privacy policy provisions.  For some providers,
failed-message reporting is viewed as a function
similar to complaint reporting about spamming or phishing and is
treated similarly under the privacy policy.  Report generators (i.e.,
Mail Receivers) are encouraged to review their reporting limitations
under such policies before enabling DMARC reporting.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="report-recipients"><name>Report Recipients</name>
<t>A DMARC record can specify that reports should be sent to an
intermediary operating on behalf of the Domain Owner.  This is done
when the Domain Owner contracts with an entity to monitor mail
streams for abuse and performance issues.  Receipt by third parties
of such data may or may not be permitted by the Mail Receiver's
privacy policy, terms of use, or other similar governing document.
Domain Owners and Mail Receivers should both review and understand if
their own internal policies constrain the use and transmission of
DMARC reporting.</t>
<t>Some potential exists for report recipients to perform traffic
analysis, making it possible to obtain metadata about the Receiver's
traffic.  In addition to verifying compliance with policies,
Receivers need to consider that before sending reports to a third
party.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>This section discusses security issues related to DMARC reporting, and
possible remediations.</t>

<section anchor="attacks-on-reporting-uris"><name>Attacks on Reporting URIs</name>
<t>URIs published in DNS TXT records are well-understood possible
targets for attack.  Specifications such as <xref target="RFC1035"></xref> and <xref target="RFC2142"></xref> either
expose or cause the exposure of email addresses that could be flooded
by an attacker, for example; MX, NS, and other records found in the
DNS advertise potential attack destinations; common DNS names such as
&quot;www&quot; plainly identify the locations at which particular services can
be found, providing destinations for targeted denial-of-service or
penetration attacks.</t>
<t>Thus, Domain Owners will need to harden these addresses against
various attacks, including but not limited to:</t>

<ul>
<li><t>high-volume denial-of-service attacks;</t>
</li>
<li><t>deliberate construction of malformed reports intended to identify
or exploit parsing or processing vulnerabilities;</t>
</li>
<li><t>deliberate construction of reports containing false claims for the
Submitter or Reported-Domain fields, including the possibility of
false data from compromised but known Mail Receivers.</t>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="dns-security"><name>DNS Security</name>
<t>The DMARC mechanism and its underlying technologies (SPF, DKIM)
depend on the security of the DNS.  To reduce the risk of subversion
of the DMARC mechanism due to DNS-based exploits, serious
consideration should be given to the deployment of DNSSEC in parallel
with the deployment of DMARC by both Domain Owners and Mail
Receivers.</t>
<t>Publication of data using DNSSEC is relevant to Domain Owners and
third-party Report Receivers.  DNSSEC-aware resolution is relevant to
Mail Receivers and Report Receivers.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="external-report-addresses"><name>External Reporting Addresses</name>
<t>To avoid abuse by bad actors, reporting addresses generally have to
be inside the domains about which reports are requested.  In order to
accommodate special cases such as a need to get reports about domains
that cannot actually receive mail, <xref target="verifying-external-destinations"></xref> describes a DNS-based
mechanism for verifying approved external reporting.</t>
<t>The obvious consideration here is an increased DNS load against
domains that are claimed as external recipients.  Negative caching
will mitigate this problem, but only to a limited extent, mostly
dependent on the default TTL in the domain's SOA record.</t>
<t>Where possible, external reporting is best achieved by having the
report be directed to domains that can receive mail and simply having
it automatically forwarded to the desired external destination.</t>
<t>Note that the addresses shown in the &quot;ruf&quot; tag receive more
information that might be considered private data, since it is
possible for actual email content to appear in the failure reports.
The URIs identified there are thus more attractive targets for
intrusion attempts than those found in the &quot;rua&quot; tag.  Moreover,
attacking the DNS of the subject domain to cause failure data to be
routed fraudulently to an attacker's systems may be an attractive
prospect.  Deployment of <xref target="RFC4033"></xref> is advisable if this is a concern.</t>
<t>The verification mechanism presented in <xref target="verifying-external-destinations"></xref> is currently not
mandatory (&quot;MUST&quot;) but strongly recommended (&quot;SHOULD&quot;).  It is
possible that it would be elevated to a &quot;MUST&quot; by later security
review.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="secure-protocols"><name>Secure Protocols</name>
<t>This document encourages use of secure transport mechanisms to
prevent loss of private data to third parties that may be able to
monitor such transmissions.  Unencrypted mechanisms should be
avoided.</t>
<t>In particular, a message that was originally encrypted or otherwise
secured might appear in a report that is not sent securely, which
could reveal private information.</t>

<section anchor="examples"><name>Examples</name>
<t>This section presents some examples related to the use of DMARC
reporting functions.</t>

<section anchor="entire-domain-monitoring-only-per-message-reports"><name>Entire Domain, Monitoring Only, Per-Message Reports</name>
<t>The Domain Owner from the previous example has used the aggregate
reporting to discover some messaging systems that had not yet
implemented DKIM correctly, but they are still seeing periodic
authentication failures.  In order to diagnose these intermittent
problems, they wish to request per-message failure reports when
authentication failures occur.</t>
<t>Not all Receivers will honor such a request, but the Domain Owner
feels that any reports it does receive will be helpful enough to
justify publishing this record.  The default per-message report
format (<xref target="RFC6591"></xref>) meets the Domain Owner's needs in this scenario.</t>
<t>The Domain Owner accomplishes this by adding the following to its
policy record from (<xref target="RFC7489"></xref> domain-owner-example):</t>

<ul>
<li>Per-message failure reports should be sent via email to the
address &quot;auth-reports@example.com&quot;
(&quot;ruf=mailto:auth-reports@example.com&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<t>The DMARC policy record might look like this when retrieved using a
common command-line tool (the output shown would appear on a single
line but is wrapped here for publication):</t>

<artwork>  % dig +short TXT _dmarc.example.com.
  &quot;v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com;
   ruf=mailto:auth-reports@example.com&quot;
</artwork>
<t>To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for the Domain Owner
might create an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
(following the conventional zone file format):</t>

<artwork>  ; DMARC record for the domain example.com

  _dmarc  IN TXT ( &quot;v=DMARC1; p=none; &quot;
                    &quot;rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com; &quot;
                    &quot;ruf=mailto:auth-reports@example.com&quot; )
</artwork>
</section>

<section anchor="per-message-failure-reports-directed-to-third-party"><name>Per-Message Failure Reports Directed to Third Party</name>
<t>The Domain Owner from the previous example is maintaining the same
policy but now wishes to have a third party receive and process the
per-message failure reports.  Again, not all Receivers will honor
this request, but those that do may implement additional checks to
validate that the third party wishes to receive the failure reports
for this domain.</t>
<t>The Domain Owner needs to alter its policy record from <xref target="entire-domain-monitoring-only-per-message-reports"></xref>
as follows:</t>

<ul>
<li>Per-message failure reports should be sent via email to the
address &quot;auth-reports@thirdparty.example.net&quot;
(&quot;ruf=mailto:auth-reports@thirdparty.example.net&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<t>The DMARC policy record might look like this when retrieved using a
common command-line tool (the output shown would appear on a single
line but is wrapped here for publication):</t>

<artwork>  % dig +short TXT _dmarc.example.com.
  &quot;v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com;
   ruf=mailto:auth-reports@thirdparty.example.net&quot;
</artwork>
<t>To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for the Domain Owner
might create an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
(following the conventional zone file format):</t>

<artwork>  ; DMARC record for the domain example.com

  _dmarc IN TXT ( &quot;v=DMARC1; p=none; &quot;
                  &quot;rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com; &quot;
                  &quot;ruf=mailto:auth-reports@thirdparty.example.net&quot; )
</artwork>
<t>Because the address used in the &quot;ruf&quot; tag is outside the
Organizational Domain in which this record is published, conforming
Receivers will implement additional checks as described in
<xref target="verifying-external-destinations"></xref> of this document.  In order to pass these additional
checks, the third party will need to publish an additional DNS record
as follows:</t>

<ul>
<li>Given the DMARC record published by the Domain Owner at
&quot;_dmarc.example.com&quot;, the DNS administrator for the third party
will need to publish a TXT resource record at
&quot;example.com._report._dmarc.thirdparty.example.net&quot; with the value
&quot;v=DMARC1;&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<t>The resulting DNS record might look like this when retrieved using a
common command-line tool (the output shown would appear on a single
line but is wrapped here for publication):</t>

<artwork>  % dig +short TXT example.com._report._dmarc.thirdparty.example.net
  &quot;v=DMARC1;&quot;
</artwork>
<t>To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for example.net might
create an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
(following the conventional zone file format):</t>

<artwork>  ; zone file for thirdparty.example.net
  ; Accept DMARC failure reports on behalf of example.com

  example.com._report._dmarc   IN   TXT    &quot;v=DMARC1;&quot;
</artwork>
<t>Intermediaries and other third parties should refer to
<xref target="verifying-external-destinations"></xref> for the full details of this
mechanism.</t>
